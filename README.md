# Tip Calculator Built with React

TODO:

~~- Conditional on `custom` input.~~
  (solution was a click even on the label, and a boolean on a new change in state called custom)

- Currently NaN or infinity shows up in display when there's only partial state.
  ~~- Make it so only $0.00 appears unless all input states have a value.~~
  - Make sure it keeps updating when those states change.

- Active States - Error message
  - Create an error message (text align right) above the Bill & Number of People inputs.

- Gray out Reset button when there is no values in the input states.

~~- Add icons to inputs~~

- Desktop display
  - Main a centered Element Box
  - Flex inputs and display to horizontal

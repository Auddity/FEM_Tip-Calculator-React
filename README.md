# Tip Calculator Built with React

TODO:

- Conditional on `custom` input.
  - Input needs to remain visable even when it's NOT checked
  - Make visible based on input having a value
    - input`custom`.value

- Currently NaN or infinity shows up in display when there's only partial state.
  ~~- Make it so only $0.00 appears unless all input states have a value.~~
  - Make sure it keeps updating when those states change.

- Active States - Error message
  - Create an error message (text align right) above the Bill & Number of People inputs.

- Gray out Reset button when there is no values in the input states.

~~- Add icons to inputs ~~

- Desktop display
  - Main a centered Element Box
  - Flex inputs and display to horizontal
